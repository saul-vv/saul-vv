## Data Scientist & Machine Learning Enthusiast | Problem Solver | Continuous Learner

With a background in Industrial Engineering and a growing skill set in Data Science, I bring a practical, problem-solving mindset to analyzing data and building solutions. My experience as an engineer in the automotive industry has taught me to approach challenges systematically, work in a detail-oriented fashion, and think critically, all of which I apply to my work as Data Scientist.

My experience so far includes:

- Data Analysis: Cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data to uncover insights.
- Machine Learning: Developing supervised and unsupervised models, convolutional neural networks and natural language processing (NLP).
- Programming: Proficient in Python and SQL, with experience in popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.

Looking forward to connecting with other professionals in data science, analytics, and tech as I continue to grow in this exciting field!
